### 🛠️ Technologies Used

| Technology        | Purpose                              |
|-------------------|--------------------------------------|
| JavaFX            | Rich desktop interface               |
| Scene Builder     | GUI design                           |

### CSV File Structures
- `users.csv` → `username,password,fullName,email,role`
- `bugs.csv` → `bugId,title,type,priority,level,projectName,dateReported,status,testerUsername,developerUsername,screenshotPath,dateClosed`

**This division is perfectly fair** — everyone writes significant logic, deals with file I/O, and contributes to a complete working system.
